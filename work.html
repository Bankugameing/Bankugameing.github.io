        <h1>My Work (A list of it)</h1>
        <strong>
            Before you check out my work, just remember that it's mostly in python and if you're<br/>curious, the IDE that I use is Thonny*.<br/>
            <footnote>*You can get thonny <a href="https://thonny.org">here</a>.</footnote><br/><br/>
            Now, let's see my WORKKKKKKKKK!<br/>
            <h2>1. My First Python Program</h2>
            The first python program that I made is called, ironically, "Cool AI Code". What.<br/><br/>
            <img src="cool-ai-code-file.png"><br/><br/>
            Yes. It really is called "Cool AI Code". It had NOTHING to do with AI. It's just a program with variables.<br/>
            Here, let me show you a screenshot from Thonny.<br/><br>
            <img src="cool-ai-code-thonny.png"><br/><br/>
            Why didnt I just do \n\n instead of print(" ") on two lines? idk. I knew nothing back then.<br/>
            This is all I knew about python. Variables. Functions. Print function. Input function. Int(Input()) combination.<br/>
            Though I didn't know how to use the int function normally. All I knew is it converted the input into a number. Cool. VERY cool. (sarcasm)<br/><br/>
